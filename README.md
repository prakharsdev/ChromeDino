# Using a genetic algorithm as a gameplay mechanic to play Chrome Dino game🦖
 
### In the game, we implemented our own genetic algorithm which mimics the process of natural evolution that is selection, mutation and crossover. In the framework, the population of Dino evolves iteratively in each generation to increase the fitness of Dino to jump over all the cacti.
